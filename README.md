Hereâ€™s the README for the Movies JSX Project that fetches movie data from an API and displays actors with two or more movies:

Movies JSX Project
This React-based project fetches movie data from an API and displays actors who have appeared in two or more movies, along with the details of those movies. The app makes use of useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and fetching data asynchronously.

Features
Actors with Two or More Movies: Displays actors who have appeared in two or more movies.
Movie Details: Shows the movie name and director for each movie an actor has been in.
API Integration: Fetches movie data from an API endpoint and processes it to display the relevant information.
Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and handling component logic.
Axios: To fetch movie data from an external API.
JSX: For defining the UI structure and conditional rendering.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) must be installed on your machine. If you haven't installed them, download and install from Node.js official website.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repoName.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd movies-jsx
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Ensure you have a backend API running at http://localhost:4500/movies that provides the movie data. The API should return a list of movies, each containing:

actor: Name of the actor.
movieName: Name of the movie.
movieDirector: Name of the director.
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Code Explanation
Fetching Data
The application fetches movie data from the API using axios inside the useEffect hook. When the component mounts, it calls the fetchMovies function, which retrieves the movie data from the API and stores it in the movies state.

Grouping Actors
The findActorsWithTwoOrMoreMovies function processes the fetched movie data to group movies by actor. It counts how many movies each actor has and filters out those who have fewer than two movies.

Displaying Results
The actors who have two or more movies are displayed in a list, along with the movie names and directors for each actor.

Example Output
If there are actors with two or more movies, the app will display a list of their names, along with the details of each movie they have appeared in. For example:

yaml
Copy code
Actor: Actor A
- Movie Name: Movie 1 | Director: Director A
- Movie Name: Movie 2 | Director: Director B
If no actors meet the criteria, the message "No actors have two or more movies." will be displayed.
